# here's a quick over view of our members and their github stats! (because we cant show you the organization's stats) and a quick overview of our small team:
## Overview:
We're a small team made of well, a single coder (patch) because Lunar is currently learning JS/Python. But we're basically just people who are bored in life and have nothing better to do! (probably just patch)
why "cerealwithfluster"? because [fluster](https://pixel.devpage.me) (btw if u visit the site, it doesnt work because it's an outdated version, patch has made a new version of Fluster but hasn't released it.) was a project we (patch) was working on, And well cerealwithmilk was taken so we just said "meh, fuhq it let's just go with cerealwithfluster" and yea.
TLDR: stupid idiot coder team (of 1 person because person 2 is learning)
